and hateful conduct policies in our Learn More article.\n", "What do I do about people being harassing or hateful in my chat while I\u2019m offline or AFK?\n", "We ask that streamers make a good faith effort to moderate their chat with tools like AutoMod, building a moderation team, and/or by utilizing the numerous third party tools available.\n", "So long as you are not turning a blind eye to content or conduct that violates the Community Guidelines, you should feel confident that no punitive actions will be taken on your channel.\n", "Ultimately, you will have to decide what steps are right for your stream and your community\u2019s behavior in order to abide by the Community Guidelines.\n", "Remember to temporarily disable or mute any unmoderated interactive elements such as

Harassment .\n", "Why is Twitch moderating off-Twitch conduct?\n", "We recognize that harassment against Twitch community members can sometimes originate from off-Twitch conduct.\n", "Our desire to

variety of content and activities creators engage in, an explicit dress code would be unreasonably restrictive.\n", "Streaming is a public activity that reaches a global audience of many ages and cultures, and as such we prohibit nudity and sexual conduct.\n", "When evaluating reports for sexual conduct, attire is just one factor we will use in making a determination on whether conduct is acceptable.\n", "We recommend creators wear attire that would be publicly appropriate for the context, location, and activity they are broadcasting.\n"]}, {"terms": ["hate"], "text": ["If flagged as
